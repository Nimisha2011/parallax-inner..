        <p>My Favourite Hobby is Swimming,the first reason that I love swimming as it can be extremely relaxing. I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless. I find that whenever I leave the pool I feel totally relaxed. On the other hand, it can also be a fast-paced competitive sport which raises your heartbeat.I totally enjoy this activity as it is a complete workout for me. It not also helps me to relax but also helps me to rejuvinate. Swimming is my passion and one day i will learn it completely.</p>
